					<h3><i><font color="#744c60"><b>A Wrinkle in Time</b></font></i></h3>
					<p><font color="#744c60">A science fantasy novel written by Madeleine L'Engle. The story revolves around a young girl

three celestial beings known as Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which, the children travel

the darkness known as IT. Meg must embrace her inner strength and love to save her father 
and ultimately triumph over evil. "A Wrinkle in Time" explores themes of courage,

					<ul>
						<li><font color="#744c60"><b> “I think ... I said things to Silas. He’ll be angry. ”
“If he didn’t care about you, you couldn’t upset him, ” was all she said. (p. 198)</b></font></li>
                        <br>
						<p><font color="#744c60">Voice One: The relationship between Bob and Silas is a testament to the depth and complexity 
of familial love. Despite the love and care that Silas provides, Bob worries about upsetting 
Silas and causing him to be angry. Silas's love for Bob is so strong that he would not become 
angry unless he truly cared about him.</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#744c60">Voice Two: I used to have arguments with my parents over minor things, and whenever I 
heard hurtful words, it would bring me to tears. This situation highlights the special bond I 
share with my family. Despite the conflicts, there is a deep love and connection between us 
that sometimes even results in playing favorites with each other.</font></p>
						<li><font color="#744c60"><b>“Because there are mysteries. Because there are things that people are forbidden to speak 
about. Because there are things they do not remember.” ( p.164)</b></font></li>
						<br>
						<p><font color="#744c60">Voice One: Bod was upset that everyone refused to talk about the Macabray, a word used to 
describe something unpleasant. Silas taught Bod that people often avoid speaking about 
certain things as a way to get away with it. The author turned the word "Macabre" into 
"Macabray" to suggest that the celebration was actually the horrible things happened in 
reality</font></p>
						<p><font color="#744c60">Voice Two: My family don't talk about the deaths of family members, which has been 
confusing to me. When my grandpa died, I was unable to ask my parents about how he died, 
fearing he had been suffering for a long time. Despite this, I still don't know what happened 
and don't want to talk about it.</font></p>
						<li><font color="#744c60"><b>“We want you to surprise us and disappoint us and impress us and amaze us. Come home, 
Bod.” (p.198)</b></font></li>
						<br>
						<p><font color="#744c60">Voice One: We strive to meet others' expectations, but if someone tells us "I want you to 
disappoint us" we feel touched and encouraged to try.</font></p>
						
						
					</ul>
					<hr style="border-color:#bfabab"/>

					<h3><i><b><font color="#744c60">A Wrinkle in Time</font></b></i></h3>
					
					<ul>
						<li><font color="#744c60"><b> “Well, sure,” Calvin said. “Here. But it’s pretty complicated.”
Meg smoothed out the paper and studied it. “Do they care how you do it?” She asked. “I mean, 
can you work it out your own way?” (p. 49)</b></font></li>
                        <br>
						<p><font color="#744c60">Voice One: Teachers should encourage exploration and alternative solutions to problems, 
while acknowledging and rewarding unconventional thinking and problem-solving abilities, to 
promote a learning environment that nurtures growth and empowers students to become 
confident problem solvers.</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#744c60">Voice Two: My math teacher had a harsh punishment policy for students who performed 
poorly or scored low grades, which led to me giving up on math. I wish I had encountered a 
teacher who appreciated different approaches to learning.</font></p>
						<li><font color="#744c60"><b>“We don’t know what things look like, as you say,” the beast said. “We know what things are 
like. It must be a very limiting thing, this seeing.” (p. 199)</b></font></li>
						<br>
						<p><font color="#744c60">Voice One: Vision is important for learning new things, but it can be shallow and lead to false 
categorization. We should be grateful for it, but it can also blind us to the true color of things 
and lead to false categorization.</font></p>
						<p><font color="#744c60">Voice Two: In kindergarten, there was a beautiful classmate who excelled in ballet, captivating 
everyone's admiration except for mine. Everyone were blinded by her beauty and failed to 
recognize her evil.</font></p>
						<li><font color="#744c60"><b>“Nobody suffers here,” Charles intoned. “Nobody is every unhappy.” 
 “But nobody’s every happy, either,” Meg said earnestly. 
 “Maybe if you aren’t unhappy sometimes you don’t know how to be happy. Calvin, I want to go 
home.” (p.157)</b></font></li>
						<br>
						<p><font color="#744c60">Voice One: Experiencing unhappiness is essential to truly understand and appreciate 
happiness, as a life devoid of suffering and challenges would eventually lead to a lack of 
genuine happiness.
</font></p>
